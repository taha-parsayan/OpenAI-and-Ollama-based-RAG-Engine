      The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate
clinical aspects related to the use of PET/MRI in oncologic
and neurologic diagnosis, and to illustrate the application
of this imaging modality with examples extracted from
the authors’ caseload and preliminary experience.

METHODS
Five clinical cases involving patients referred to our
institution for PET/CT are described in this article.
Patients were submitted can PET/MRI immediately after
PET/CT,       without      any    further     intravenous        contrast
agent injection for improved lesion characterization.
Image acquisition was performed between 60 and 90
minutes, after intravenous injection of 148 to 333MBq of
specific radiotracers (18F-FDG, Fluorodeoxyglucose or
68Ga-PSMA, prostate-specific membrane antigen labeled
with68Ga). Scanning time ranged from 30 to 90 minutes;
images with high anatomical resolution and excellent
soft tissue contrast were obtained.

PET/MRI
PET/MRI with attenuation correction were acquired
using     dual    echo     VIBE      Dixon      or    ultrashort     echo
time sequences for water and fat or bone separation.
Anatomical MRI sequences were selected according to
the type of exam (whole-body, head and neck, female
and male pelvis or neurologic protocols). Simultaneous
acquisition of PET images was performed using the
following parameters: 500mm FOV, 400mm anterior-
posterior FOV, 1.0 zoom, 3 interactions, 21 subsets,
HD PET reconstruction method, and 2.0mm Gaussian
filter (oncological assessment); or 300mm FOV, 300mm
anterior-posterior FOV, 1.0 zoom, 8 interactions, 21
subsets, HD PET reconstruction and 2.0mm Gaussian
filter (neurological assessment).


Whole-body PET/MRI in oncology
Whole-body PET/MRI is particularly indicated in cases
requiring both the advantages of PET in detecting
extramedullary disease, and the superiority of MRI
in detecting spinal cord compression, extramedullary
disease      and    active     post-treatment         residual      sites.
Therefore        this   novel     technology        is  an   attractive
alternative for multiple myeloma and bone metastasis
assessment(4) (Figure 1).

Head-and-neck PET/MRI
The role of PET/MRI in head and neck cancer diagnosis
was first investigated by Boss et al.(5)
modality is attractive due to superior soft tissue contrast
and the lower susceptibility of MRI to artifacts generated
by dental metallic implants compared to CT.(6)
       High spatial resolution and contrast of MRI are
vital for tumor and regional lymph node staging in
this complex anatomical region, given the ability of
the method to delineate the actual tumor extent and
distinguish lymph node involvement from surrounding
normal tissue. Also, PET/MRI can be useful to detect
distant         metastatic            spread,          thereby
radiation therapy and preoperative treatment planning
(Figure 2).

               PET/MRI in neurology                                                                                 information            for    easier       recognition           of  degeneration
               Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for                                             patterns specific to Parkinson’s disease, multiple system
               neuro-oncologic imaging, neurodegenerative diseases and                                              atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal
               epilepsy.(2,9)      Multimodal PET/MRI can provide functional                                        degeneration(10) (Figure 5).

CONCLUSION

PET/MRI is among the most exciting recent developments
in non-invasive hybrid imaging; the combination of
anatomical and functional imaging modalities and
the use of different tracers to provide comprehensive

valuable information. Growing experience with PET/
MRI suggests it could become the imaging modality of

choice, particularly for assessment of some regions, such as
brain, head and neck, liver and pelvis. However, widely
accepted clinical indications remain to be determined

before conclusive statements regarding the advantages
of PET/MRI, over PET/CT can be made.
